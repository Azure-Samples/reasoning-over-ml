The purpose of this model is to predict the presence of heart disease based on the following features with example values:

- age, sex, cp, trestbps, chol, fbs, restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal
- Example: 63, 1, 1, 145, 233, 1, 2, 150, 0, 2.3, 3, 0, fixed

- age: Age of the patient (e.g., 63)
- sex: Sex of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female) (e.g., 1)
- cp: Chest pain type (e.g., 1)
- trestbps: Resting blood pressure (e.g., 145)
- chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl (e.g., 233)
- fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false) (e.g., 1)
- restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (e.g., 2)
- thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved (e.g., 150)
- exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) (e.g., 0)
- oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (e.g., 2.3)
- slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (e.g., 3)
- ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy (e.g., 0)
- thal: Thalassemia (e.g., fixed)


You will receive a request in the question with the following predicted output:

This is only an example of how the predictions should look like. The actual predictions will be different:
