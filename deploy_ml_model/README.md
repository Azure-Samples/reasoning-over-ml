# Saving and Loading Models Using Pickle  
This document describes a simplified implementation of model serialization using the pickle library. The goal of this application is to serve as a didactic and demonstrative foundation, aiding in the understanding of the fundamental concepts involved in the persistence of machine learning models.  
   
## Objective  
- Demonstrate the basic use of pickle to save and load models.  
- Serve as an introductory example for developers exploring serialization processes in Python.  

## Model Context

This section outlines the model details and dataset used in this example. The data comes from Kaggle's ["Store Sales â€“ Time Series Forecasting"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting) competition, which focuses on predicting retail sales over time. This dataset enables exploration of forecasting techniques and evaluation of model performance in a realistic scenario.

### Creating the Batch

To ensure correct environment execution, use a custom batch scoring script. This script is recommended as it logs additional content during model predictions, including statistical tests and SHAP values.

### ML Model Deployment

Before deployment, execute the `deploy.sh` script found in the `deploy-ml-model` folder. There are also automated approaches for deploying batch endpoints. This example demonstrates how to use and deploy batch endpoint pointed to you ML model:

```bash
cd deploy-ml-model
./deploy.sh
```

Ensure your storage account meets these requirements:

- Storage account key access is enabled.
- Connections are permitted from all networks or your specific IP.

### Deployment Procedure

1. **Navigate to the Deployment Directory**  
  Open your terminal and change to the `deploy_ml_model` directory:
  ```bash
  cd deploy_ml_model
  ```

2. **Configure the Deployment**  
  Update the deployment configuration file (`deployment.yml`) with your resource names and settings as needed.

3. **Deploy the Model**  
  Run the deployment command:
  ```bash
  ./deploy.sh
  ```
  Follow any on-screen prompts to finish the setup.

4. **Post-Deployment Steps**  
  After deployment, refer to the provided endpoint URL and keys to integrate with the reasoning module.
   
## Important Considerations  
- **Didactic Example:** The code presented is for educational purposes and is designed to illustrate the concepts of serialization. It does not, by itself, reflect a production-ready implementation.  
- **Best Practices Not Implemented:** In a production scenario, it is essential to adopt advanced practices, such as:  
  - Rigorous model validation.  
  - Proper exception handling.  
  - Implementation of logging.  
  - Development of unit tests.  
  - Compliance with the internal standards and guidelines of the team or organization.  
- **Context of Use:** This example is intended to provide a starting point. It is recommended to apply adjustments and incorporate best practices to ensure the robustness and reliability of the final system.  
   
## Recommendations  
Before adopting this approach for a production environment, review and integrate the following improvements:  
- Implementation of model version control.  
- Continuous monitoring and validation of models.  
- Use of exception handling and logging techniques to facilitate maintenance and debugging.
