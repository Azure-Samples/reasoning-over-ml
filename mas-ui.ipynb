            "### Key Influential Features\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Sales Rolling Mean (20 days)**\n",
            "   - **Impact**: This feature has the most significant positive impact on predictions, with SHAP values like `4.216077` and `1.9598305` in some instances. It indicates that recent sales trends over the past 20 days are crucial in driving predictions.\n",
            "   - **Significance**: A high rolling mean suggests a strong upward trend in sales, which the model interprets as a positive indicator for future sales.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **On Promotion**\n",
            "   - **Impact**: The feature \"onpromotion\" shows a substantial positive influence, with SHAP values such as `1.0573605` and `0.95163184`. This suggests that items on promotion are expected to have higher sales.\n",
            "   - **Significance**: Promotions are a strong driver of sales, and their presence significantly boosts the prediction.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Specific Day Sales Average**\n",
            "   - **Impact**: This feature has mixed effects, with both positive (`0.40363818`) and negative (`-0.34905005`) SHAP values. It reflects the average sales on specific days, which can vary based on historical performance.\n",
            "   - **Significance**: Understanding specific day trends helps in adjusting predictions based on past performance on similar days.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Month and Month Name**\n",
            "   - **Impact**: These features have moderate positive impacts, with SHAP values like `0.08779588` and `0.10820709`. They capture seasonal trends and monthly variations in sales.\n",
            "   - **Significance**: Seasonal patterns and monthly variations are important for predicting sales, especially in retail contexts.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",

            "\n",
            "- **Sales Rolling Mean and On Promotion**: The interaction between recent sales trends and promotional activities can amplify the prediction. For instance, a high rolling mean combined with promotions can lead to even higher sales predictions.\n",
            "- **Month and Specific Day Sales Average**: These features together can help capture both broad seasonal trends and specific day effects, providing a nuanced understanding of sales patterns.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Actionable Insights\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Leverage Promotions**: Since promotions significantly boost sales predictions, consider strategic promotional campaigns to enhance sales, especially during high rolling mean periods.\n",
            "   \n",
            "2. **Focus on Recent Trends**: Monitor the 20-day rolling mean closely to adjust inventory and marketing strategies. A rising trend could indicate the need for increased stock and marketing efforts.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Seasonal Planning**: Use insights from month and specific day sales averages to plan for seasonal demand, ensuring adequate stock and targeted promotions during peak periods.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Day-Specific Strategies**: Analyze specific day sales averages to identify patterns and tailor marketing efforts for days with historically high or low sales.\n",
